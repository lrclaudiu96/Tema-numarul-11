    <h1>Australia</h1>
    <hr>

    <p class="p1"><strong>Australia</strong>, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country
        comprising the mainland of
        the
        Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.<span>[13]</span> With an area of
        7,617,930 square
        kilometres (2,941,300 sq mi),<span>[14]</span> Australia is the largest country by area in Oceania and the
        world's
        sixth-largest country. Australia is the oldest,<span>[15]</span> flattest,<span>[16]</span> and driest inhabited
        continent,<span>[17][18]</span> with
        the least fertile soils.<span>[19][20]</span> It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety
        of landscapes
        and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, and mountain ranges in the
        south-east.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="p2">The ancestors of Aboriginal Australians began arriving from south east Asia approximately 65,000 years
        ago,
        during the last ice age.<span>[21][22]</span> Arriving by sea, they settled the continent and had formed
        approximately 250
        distinct language groups by the time of European settlement, maintaining some of the longest known continuing
        artistic and religious traditions in the world.<span>[21]</span> Australia's written history commenced with the
        European
        maritime exploration of Australia. The Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon was the first known European to reach
        Australia, in 1606. In 1770, the British explorer James Cook mapped and claimed the east coast of Australia for
        Great Britain, and the First Fleet of British ships arrived at Sydney in 1788 to establish the penal colony of
        New South Wales. The European population grew in subsequent decades, and by the end of the 1850s gold rush, most
        of the continent had been explored by European settlers and an additional five self-governing British colonies
        established. Democratic parliaments were gradually established through the 19th century, culminating with a vote
        for the federation of the six colonies and foundation of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901.
        Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system and wealthy market economy.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="p3">Politically, Australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and
        ten
        territories. Australia's population of nearly 26 million<span>[7]</span> is highly urbanised and heavily
        concentrated on the
        eastern seaboard.<span>[23]</span> Canberra is the nation's capital, while its most populous city and financial
        centre is
        Sydney. The next four largest cities are Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. Australia's demography has
        been shaped by centuries of immigration: immigrants account for 30% of the country's population,[24] and almost
        half of Australians have at least one parent born overseas.<span>[25]</span> Australia's abundant natural
        resources and
        well-developed international trade relations are crucial to the country's economy, which generates its income
        from various sources including services, mining exports, banking, manufacturing, agriculture and international
        education.<span>[26][27][28]</span></p>
    <br>
    <p class="p4">Australia is a highly developed country with a high-income economy. As of 2022, it was the world's
        fourteenth-largest economy with the ninth-highest per capita income.<span>[29]</span> In 2021, it ranked as
        fifth-highest
        Human Development Index.<span>[30][31]</span> Australia is a regional power, and has the world's
        thirteenth-highest military
        expenditure.<span>[32]</span> Australia ranks amongst the highest in the world for quality of life, democracy,
        health,
        education, economic freedom, civil liberties, safety, and political rights,<span>[33]</span> with all its major
        cities faring
        exceptionally in global comparative livability surveys.<span>[34]</span> It is a member of international
        groupings including
        the United Nations, the G20, the OECD, the WTO, ANZUS, AUKUS, Five Eyes, the Quad, APEC, the Pacific Islands
        Forum, the Pacific Community and the Commonwealth of Nations.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="p5">Etymology</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="p6">The name Australia (pronounced /əˈstreɪliə/ in Australian English<span>[35]</span>) is derived from
        the Latin Terra Australis
        ("southern land"), a name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since ancient
        times.<span>[36]</span>
        Several sixteenth century cartographers used the word Australia on maps, but not to identify modern
        Australia.<span>[37]</span> When Europeans first began visiting and mapping Australia in the 17th century, the
        name Terra
        Australis was naturally applied to the new territories.<span>[N 4]</span>

        Until the early 19th century, Australia was best known as New Holland, a name first applied by the Dutch
        explorer Abel Tasman in 1644 (as Nieuw-Holland) and subsequently anglicised. Terra Australis still saw
        occasional usage, such as in scientific texts.<span>[N 5]</span> The name Australia was popularised by the
        explorer Matthew
        Flinders, who said it was "more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great
        portions of the Earth".<span>[43]</span> The first time that Australia appears to have been officially used was
        in April
        1817, when Governor Lachlan Macquarie acknowledged the receipt of Flinders' charts of Australia from Lord
        Bathurst.<span>[44]</span> In December 1817, Macquarie recommended to the Colonial Office that it be formally
        adopted.<span>[45]</span> In
        1824, the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially by that name.<span>[46]</span> The
        first official
        published use of the new name came with the publication in 1830 of The Australia Directory by the Hydrographic
        Office.<span>[47]</span>

        Colloquial names for Australia include "Oz" and "the Land Down Under" (usually shortened to just "Down Under").
        Other epithets include "the Great Southern Land", "the Lucky Country", "the Sunburnt Country", and "the Wide
        Brown Land". The latter two both derive from Dorothea Mackellar's 1908 poem "My Country".<span>[48]</span>
